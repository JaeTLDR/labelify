= labelify

labelify is a small Python command line application that analyses a given RDF graph (a file) and prints a list of subject, predicated and or objects IRIs that don't have labels.

Example use:

[source,shell]
---
pip install git+https://github.com/Kurrawong/labelify
---

[source,shell]
----
labelify qldgeofeatures.ttl -c qldgeofeatures-dataset/background-onts -l https://schema.org/name,http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core\#
----

The above call analyses qldgeofeatures.ttl for labels for all s, p & o and looks within the RDF files in qldgeofeatures-dataset/background-onts to find them. It treats `sdo:name` and `skos:prefLabel` as labels as well as the default `rdfs:label`

usage: labelify [-h] [-v] [-c CONTEXT] [-s {true,false}] [-l LABELS] [-n {subjects,predicates,objects,all}] [-e {true,false}] input

positional arguments:
  input                 Input RDF file being analysed

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -c CONTEXT, --context CONTEXT
                        A folder path containing RDF files or a single RDF file path to the ontology(ies) containing labels for the input
  -s {true,false}, --supress {true,false}
                        Produces no output if set to 'true'. This is used for testing only
  -l LABELS, --labels LABELS
                        A list of predicates (IRIs) to looks for that indicate labels. A comma-delimited list may be supplied or the path of a file containing labelling IRIs, one per line
                        may be supplied. Default is RDFS.label
  -n {subjects,predicates,objects,all}, --nodetype {subjects,predicates,objects,all}
                        The type of node you want to check for labels. Select 'subject', 'predicate', 'object' or 'all'
  -e {true,false}, --evaluate {true,false}
                        Evaluate nodes in the context graphs for labels
